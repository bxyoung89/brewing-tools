Well it&#39;s because you have two choices: <strong>Make Juice</strong> or <strong>Buy Juice</strong>.</p>\n<p>The important part is that you get juice that is <strong>pasturized</strong> (unless you want to risk it being sour).</p>\n<h3 id="buy-juice">Buy Juice</h3>\n<p>If you do <em>NOT</em> have access to a large quantity of apples, I strongly recommend you just buy the juice. If you don&#39;t have any preference I would strongly recommend buying a gallon in a glass jug that you can use  for fermenting such as the one below:</p>\n<p><img src="/brewing-tools/images/blog-images/2019-07-29/appleJuiceInGlassJug.jpg.jpg" alt="Glass Jug Juice" title="let the thrift flow over you"></p>\n<p>Once you have purchased juice go to the next step.</p>\n<h3 id="press-juice">Press Juice</h3>\n<p>If you have copious amounts of apples or money to buy apples then this approach is for you. There are three pieces of equipment you will need:</p>\n<h4 id="the-food-processor">The food processor</h4>\n<p>In order to make apple juice, you must first make apple bits. Cut apples up and put them in the food processor. Turn food processor on. You now have apple bits.</p>\n<h4 id="the-fruit-press">The Fruit Press</h4>\n<p>You squeeze the apple bits to get juice. I&#39;d recommend getting the biggest one you can so you do less pressings. Make sure you clean it first. Also make sure you put the bag in before pressing</p>\n<p><img src="/brewing-tools/images/blog-images/2019-07-29/fruitPress.gif" alt="Fruit Press" title="Apple bits, under pressure...."></p>\n<h4 id="the-bag">The Bag</h4>\n<p>Maybe your food processor is a pro and has made apple bits very fine. You do not want bits in your juice. Put the apples in the bag then the bag in your press. The bag is a muslin bag that is big enough to fit inside your fruit press.</p>\n<h3 id="pasteurizing-the-juice">Pasteurizing the Juice</h3>\n<p>If the juice isn&#39;t pasteurized then you have to pasteurize it (unless you&#39;re willing to have it maybe taste sour. If so skip this step).</p>\n<p>Put all the juice in a pot that will hold all the juice. Heat the juice up to 185 degrees fahrenheit. <strong>DO NOT GO HIGHER</strong>. Hold at 185 for 15 minutes. You have pasteurized juice.</p>\n<h2 id="step-2-fermentation">Step 2: Fermentation</h2>\n<p>For fermentation you will need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fermentation Vessel</li>\n<li>Sanitizer</li>\n<li>Airlock</li>\n<li>Yeast</li>\n<li>Hydrometer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Optionally you might like to have</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Funnel</li>\n<li>Test Jar</li>\n<li>Irish Moss/Campden Tablets</li>\n<li>Pectic Enzyme</li>\n<li>Yeast Nutrient</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The basics are: yeast + sugar = co2 + alcohol. &#39;Meber this and it&#39;ll serve you well.</p>\n<h3 id="fermentation-vessel">Fermentation Vessel</h3>\n<p>For a fermentation vessel all you really need is something that can be air tight. If you bought your juice in a glass jug, congrats you can use that. Buy a 6.5 stopper. If not you might want to consider a bucket with a tight lid as is pictured below:</p>\n<p><img src="/brewing-tools/images/blog-images/2019-07-29/fermentationBucket.jpg" alt="Fermentation Bucket" title="Hey single guy, want a bucket of cider?"></p>\n<p>If you are fancier, you can buy carboy&#39;s and such but doesn&#39;t really matter.</p>\n<h3 id="sanitizer">Sanitizer</h3>\n<p>The first rule of making booze is that everything needs to be clean and sanitized. I suggest buying StarSan and using it. It has a fun bottle too.</p>\n<p><img src="/brewing-tools/images/blog-images/2019-07-29/starsan.jpg" alt="StarSan" title="As babushka always say, &#39;Cleanliness is next to godliness&#39;"></p>\n<h3 id="airlock">Airlock</h3>\n<p>So sugar + yeast = co2 + alcohol. Given that you have an air tight fermentation vessel we need to have a way for excess co2 to be released otherwise we have an explosion. You put water in it so no air comes in: OXYGEN is no good for fermentation.</p>\n<p><img src="/brewing-tools/images/blog-images/2019-07-29/airlock.jpg" alt="Airlock" title="Lock em down"></p>\n<h3 id="yeast">Yeast</h3>\n<p>Just as you chose the juice, so too must you choose the yeast. If you&#39;re already overwhelmed, just buy US-O5. </p>\n<p><img src="/brewing-tools/images/blog-images/2019-07-29/us05.jpg" alt="US-05" title="US-05 is one hell of a yeast!"></p>\n<p>If you&#39;re not overwhelmed you can pretty much choose any beer, wine, or cider yeast. Beer yeast is probably easier to come by. You should probably stick with an ale yeast or, especially if you&#39;re in hotter climates, a saison yeast.</p>\n<h3 id="hydrometer">Hydrometer</h3>\n<p>You will, without a doubt want to know how strong your cider is. To do this you must use a tool called a hydrometer. You put it in liquid and read from the meniscus. You should use the scale that&#39;s like 1.050. You may need to correct for temperature. Lucky for you <a href="https://bxyoung89.github.io/brewing-tools/#/hydrometer-correction">a tool</a> to do the correction exists. </p>\n<h3 id="optional-stuff">Optional stuff</h3>\n<h4 id="funnel">Funnel</h4>\n<p>If your juice isn&#39;t already in your fermentation vessel, you&#39;ll need something to get it there. Funnel is good for this.</p>\n<h4 id="test-jar">Test Jar</h4>\n<p>In order to make getting a measurement from the hydrometer easier, you need something that is long and clear. This is called a test jar. If you&#39;re some sort of chemist and have a graduated cylinder, use that.</p>\n<h4 id="irish-mosscampden-tablets">Irish Moss/Campden Tablets</h4>\n<p>Both of these make impurities fall to the bottom. If you don&#39;t want em, no big sweat.</p>\n<h4 id="pectic-enzyme">Pectic Enzyme</h4>\n<p>This makes your cider clear. Pectin is a protein that causes your cider to be cloudy. Pectic Enzyme eats this protein and makes your cider clear. If you don&#39;t care about clarity, skip this.</p>\n<h4 id="yeast-nutrient">Yeast Nutrient</h4>\n<p>Cider is already yeast valhalla but if you want to make 100% sure your yeast is super happy go ahead and add this in. Otherwise don&#39;t worry about it.</p>\n<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do</h3>\n<p>First, sanitize everything that isn&#39;t a powder or tablet. Mix StarSan with water and now you have sanitization liquid. Dip/coat all the things with sanitization liquid.</p>\n<p>Pour some of the juice into your test jar (or alternatively just put the hydrometer into your juice). Write this reading down (this is called your Original Gravity or OG for short). It will be important for later.</p>\n<p>Put the juice in your sanitized fermentation vessel. If you have Irish Moss/Campden Tablets, Pectic Enzyme, and/or Yeast nutrient put them in too.</p>\n<p><strong>MAKE SURE THE JUICE IS AT 80 DEGREES OR LESS</strong></p>\n<p>Put the yeast into the fermentation vessel.</p>\n<p>Fill your airlock with water up to the fill line.</p>\n<p>Put your stopper/lid/whatever on top of your fermentation vessel. Put your airlock into lid/stopper/etc...</p>\n<p>Congrats, you have technically made cider.</p>\n<p>Store the cider contraption in a cool dark place for 2 weeks. After 24-48 hours you should see your airlock bubbling. This means fermentation has started.</p>\n<p><em>Optional Step: Cold crashing</em> If there&#39;s junk on top or you want more clarity, put your cider in a fridge for a week. </p>\n<h2 id="step-3-packaging">Step 3: Packaging</h2>\n<p>At this point your cider should now be alcoholic but has no carbonation. First you should figure out how strong it is the cider that you made. Take another hydrometer reading. This is your Final Gravity (FG). Use <a href="https://bxyoung89.github.io/brewing-tools/#/abv-calculator">the greatest tool known to man</a> to figure out what abv your cider is.</p>\n<p>Now you have three choices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>enjoy non-carbonated alcoholic cider</li>\n<li>carbonate the bottle in cider</li>\n<li>put the cider into a keg and carbonate </li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id="enjoy-with-no-carbonation">Enjoy With No Carbonation</h3>\n<p>What are you doing here? Go drink your cider.</p>\n<h3 id="bottle-carbonation-conditioning">Bottle Carbonation (Conditioning)</h3>\n<p>Equipment you will need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Food Safe Hose (I think 1/2 inch is better)</li>\n<li>Bottling Wand (make sure it matches your hose)</li>\n<li>Bottles</li>\n<li>Sugar (I like corn sugar)</li>\n<li>Caps/Corks</li>\n<li>Capper/Corker</li>\n<li>Bucket</li>\n<li>Sanitizer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Equipment you might like</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Autosiphon</li>\n<li>Bottle Rinser</li>\n<li>Phone Book</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First you need to figure out <a href="https://bxyoung89.github.io/brewing-tools/#/priming-sugar-calculator">how much sugar you need</a>.</p>\n<p>Due to the siphoning process you might want to move your cider to where you&#39;re gonna bottle. This pretty much needs to be any surface that&#39;s not the floor. I also like tilting the cider with a phone book to make it easy to get more out.</p>\n<p>First sanitize everything that is not the sugar.</p>\n<p>Put the sugar in your bucket. </p>\n<p>Now you need to harness the power of gravity to move the cider into the bucket. Put the bucket on the floor below where your cider currently is. If you have an auto-siphon (which is like 10 bucks) this is way easier. Put the auto-siphon or your hose into the fermentation vessel. Put the other end into the bucket. Start the siphon and watch the liquid flow from top to bottom. Try to avoid the gunk at the bottom (called trub).</p>\n<p>Now that you have your cider in your bottling bucket, you&#39;re basically going to do it all over again. Move your bucket to an elevated position. This time, on the end that isn&#39;t going to the bucket, attach the bottling wand. Grab a bottle, start the siphon, and fill the bottle to the top then remove the bottling wand. This will leave enough headspace for proper carbonation.</p>\n<p>Now with your full bottle, use the capper to put on a bottle cap or a corker to put in the cork. </p>\n<p>Repeat until you run out of cider.</p>\n<p>Wait 2 to 3 weeks for your bottles to finish carbonating. </p>\n<h3 id="kegging">Kegging</h3>\n<p>Sort of the same as bottling but less steps. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>siphon your cider into your sanitized keg (no sugar needed)</li>\n<li>hook your keg up to your c02</li>\n<li>do whatever voodoo it takes to get the proper carbonation</li>\n<li>enjoy</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id="other-thoughts">Other thoughts</h2>\n<p>I started doing cider so I could do smaller batch experimentation. If you like hopped cider, just add hops in after a week or while you&#39;re cold crashing. If you like other fruits, replace some of the apple juice with that. If you want it sweeter, buy some lactose and throw that in.</p>\n<p>Currently I have a hopped cider and a sweet strawberry cider bottle conditioning. I also have a cider with my own juice and saison yeast fermenting. However going forward I&#39;ll probably just stick to buying apple juice and only juicing other fruits.</p>\n<p>I hope this was informative. Cheers!</p>\n'}}]);
