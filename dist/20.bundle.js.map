Welcome to my brewing tools site. I wanted to learn more about how everything was calculated. Specifically, I had just switched over to all grain brewing and wanted to see if I was mashing correctly (hint: I wasn&#39;t).  But I also learned that I wasn&#39;t calculating gravity correctly either. From there I started to get interested in recipe design. I wanted to know bitter my recipes were going to be. I also found a <a href=\\\"https://www.yakimachief.com/wp-content/uploads/Yakima_Chief_Hops_Varieties.pdf\\\">great pdf</a> about different oil contents. I wanted to visualize what oils were in what hops. I made a <a href=\\\"./blog/2019-1-30.md\\\">beer</a> with this information (it turned out okay). Finally I just built the tools that I tend to look up on brew days and bottling days. The big thing for me was that it was mobile friendly. All and all I&#39;m pretty happy with how everything turned out. Probably won&#39;t do any major updates unless there&#39;s some other calculation to learn but I will stop by with occasional recipes.</p>\\n<p>Happy Brewing,</p>\\n<p>Brother Derrick   </p>\\n\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
