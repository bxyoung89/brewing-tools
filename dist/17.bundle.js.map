I can&#39;t seem to get enough of those hoppy juice like beers. Locally I&#39;ve been pretty spoiled with both Electric Jellyfish by Pinthouse Pizza and Tupp&#39;s Double Dry Hop series. However, I&#39;ve noticed a pattern. It&#39;s always Citra, Mosaic, and Galaxy with few exceptions. </p>\\n<p>So I decided I wanted to decide a bit different. I also had been reading up on different hop oils due to making the <a href=\\\"https://bxyoung89.github.io/brewing-tools/#/hop-directory\\\">hop directory page</a>. I came across a interesting episode of the <a href=\\\"https://youtu.be/GCQ22HSDDUQ?t=1310\\\">beersmith podcast</a> talking about the oils. It was suggested to combine hops that are high in Linlaool and Geraniol. In order to find what hops were suitable I made a <a href=\\\"/#/hop-visualization\\\">visualization</a>. </p>\\n<p>For Linalool I went with El Dorado as I couldn&#39;t find Loral at a good price.</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/blog-images/2019-1-30/hop%20visualization%20linalool.png\\\" alt=\\\"linalool\\\" title=\\\"Linalool visualization\\\"></p>\\n<p>For Geraniol I went with Centennial as there&#39;s a couple of beers I&#39;d like to make with it in the future</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"/images/blog-images/2019-1-30/hop%20visualization%20geraniol.png\\\" alt=\\\"geraniol\\\" title=\\\"Geraniol visualization\\\"></p>\\n<p>Lastly, I wanted to add some Strata in case the combo didn&#39;t work out. </p>\\n<p>I also wanted to try out some Voss Kviek. It seemed like it&#39;d be a good match fo the style since it is known for citrus type notes.</p>\\n<p>The recipe was as follows:</p>\\n<p>| Grain | Weight |\\n| ------------- |-------------:|\\n| Blacklands Pale Moon (American 2-row)      | 15lbs |\\n| Flaked Wheat      | 2lbs |\\n| Flaked Oats | 2lbs |\\n| Rice Hulls** | 1lb |</p>\\n<p>As you can tell, the recipe is for a double but I only ended up with a single. I got a stuck sparge and my efficiency plummeted. The next batch I did I added rice hulls and had a much better result (0.010 higher in OG!).</p>\\n<p>I mashed at 154 for 90 minutes.</p>\\n<p>I did a 40 minute boil and here&#39;s the schedule I followed</p>\\n<p>| Time       | Ingredient           |\\n| ------------- |-------------|\\n| 0 min | 1oz El Dorado |\\n| 20 min | 1oz Strata |\\n| 25 min | Whirlflock &amp; Yeast Fuel |\\n| Whirlpool | 1oz El Dorado |\\n|  | 1oz Strata |\\n|  | 1oz Centennial |\\n| 1 day dry hop | 1oz El Dorado |\\n|  | 1oz Strata |\\n|  | 1oz Centennial |\\n| 3 day dry hop | 1oz El Dorado |\\n|  | 1oz Strata |\\n|  | 1oz Centennial |</p>\\n<p>I fermented for 1 week, cold crashed for 3 days, and let it sit in the bottle for 3 weeks. The aroma from the funnel during dry hopping was AMAZING, unfortunately I don&#39;t get much of that same punch now. Kviek was a beast to work with. I was amazed with how fast it fermented. I eventually want to start barrel aging a couple of beers and it will probably be my yeast of choice as it can withstand the Texas heat.</p>\\n<p>My OG was 1.062 and my FG was 1.012.  </p>\\n\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
