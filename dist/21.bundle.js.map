I&#39;ve been wanting to make the leap to kegging for a while now and I finally did it. It&#39;s been quite an experience. A couple things I&#39;d like to note:</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"batteries-not-included\\\">Batteries not included</h3>\\n<p>So while I now owned a refrigerator with towers and taps there were a couple of things that were not included that I wasn&#39;t surprised by:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>Kegs. Obviously the kegerator isn&#39;t going to come with kegs but what type should you get? I found deals on ball lock so I went with that (see following meme)</p>\\n<p>  <img src=\\\"/brewing-tools/images/blog-images/2019-6-24/kegs%20meme.png\\\" alt=\\\"Keg types meme\\\" title=\\\"Deep opinions about kegs\\\"></p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>Keg disconnects. I went with stailness steel for reasons I guess???</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p>CO2 tank with CO2</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>However there were a great deal of things I was surprised I needed to buy</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A regulator that will work for two tanks. I&#39;m still confused why a two tap kegerator wouldn&#39;t come with a double body regulator. Must be some black magic I&#39;m missing??</li>\\n<li>Proper size hose. The series 4 kegerator comes with some RIDICULOUSLY small lines. I assume this is because they REALLY want to sell their duofit stuff. I needed to buy bigger lines though</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\\"noob-mistakes\\\">Noob mistakes</h3>\\n<p>Ok so I finally bought all the things and I thought I had everything hooked up correctly. Brewed a beer (recipe to be shown later). 1 week later (bless the power of Kviek and hot texan garages) I put my beer in the keg. Somewhere I read that you should let your beer carb up for a week. Somewhere else I read to carb it up at 40psi. <strong>THESE ARE TWO CONFLICTING PIECES OF ADVICE.</strong> I spent the next two weeks trying to UNCARB this monstrosity. I understand there is variation, but I recently read that you should try 30psi for 2 days. Going to try that soon. (SPOILER ALERT THIS IS ALSO BAD ADVICE. Who knows how long this should be???)</p>\\n<p>That brings me to my next discovery. I was running low on CO2. I figured this was due to me trying to decarb my ipa so I thought I just needed to fill it up and not do that again.  After doing several weeks of home upgrades I started to develop an affinity for a certain saying my father repeated once or twice </p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Sometimes extra parts are just that... extra.`</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>When I got my double body regulator in I noticed some curious washers on the side. I didn&#39;t think anything of it at the time, so I re-hooked up my completely filled CO2 tank to the regulator and slept. The next day I noticed the tank I had just filled was only a quarter full. I tried teflon taping it and still had leaks, but then I read up on the washers. Put them in and now I have no leaks. I am now looking forward to purchasing my third refill and gaining a reputation around town as the man who hoardes CO2.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"postives\\\">Postives</h3>\\n<p>With those roadblocks on the way, I have to say, it is liberating to just siphon into a keg and call it a day. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do with my previous bottle collection (answer: probably save it exclusively for saisons, kolchs, and ciders) but I can&#39;t say I miss it.</p>\\n<p>Also growlers are a lot more portable than those beautiful belgian bottles.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"recipes\\\">Recipes</h2>\\n<p>For my first two recipes that went straight to kegs I decided to go with a classic east-west feud theme.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"big-hoppa-neipa\\\">Big Hoppa (NEIPA)</h3>\\n<p>I knew I wanted to go with something hazy and I wanted to ferment quickly.

A couple of thoughts</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>I should NOT have added the extra teaspoon of Calcium Chloride. First couple of sips have a weird metallic taste (maybe that&#39;s the over carbination though)</li>\\n<li>I definitely think I&#39;ll be adding carapils to my regular NEIPA recipe. I also think I can stand to add probably a pound of some other specialty malt. (Maybe replace the wheat with flaked rye???) </li>\\n<li>This has been my third or fourth beer with Voss Kivek. I&#39;m not sure what it is, but for me this yeast ALWAYS leads to clear beers. I think I&#39;m going to start switching to S04 to get a more hazy appearance.</li>\\n<li>I&#39;ve been reading up more on hop saturation. I don&#39;t really need 9oz in there (seems like the max for 5 gal batches is around 7oz)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\\"nothing-but-a-hop-thang-west-coast-ipa\\\">Nothing but a Hop Thang (West Coast IPA)</h3>\\n<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I definitely enjoy the haze craze, but it seems that a lot of breweries are avoiding bitter beers. I know bitterness doesn&#39;t really sell as well as it did back in the 90&#39;s but I wanted to bring it back. I&#39;ve also started reading up a bunch more on specialty malts (a.k.a. got suckered in and bought a bunch online) and wanted to experiment with them.</p>\\n<p>For the yeast I used the standard US05</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Grain</th>\\n<th align=\\\"right\\\">Weight</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody><tr>\\n<td>Blacklands Pale Moon (American 2-row)</td>\\n<td align=\\\"right\\\">12lbs</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Munich Malt</td>\\n<td align=\\\"right\\\">1lb</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Crystal 15L</td>\\n<td align=\\\"right\\\">1lb</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody></table>\\n<p>Nothing too fancy for the mash.

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because my co2 tank is inside the fridge (thus maybe inaccurate readings?) or what. I guess next time I&#39;ll try 20 psi for two days...</p>\\n<p>This beer is pretty fantastic in my estimation. When you first take a sip there&#39;s two thoughts that come to mind:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>this does NOT taste like a 7.66% beer</li>\\n<li>this does NOT taste like a 86 IBU beer</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>You get a mouth full of subtle fruity flavors then the bitterness comes: creepin and crawlin&#39;. The munich and crystal malts provide a very faint hint of sweetness. If I were to do this recipe again I might consider bumping one of those up to 2 pounds.</p>\\n\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
