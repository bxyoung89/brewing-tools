I can&#39;t seem to get enough of those hoppy juice like beers. Locally I&#39;ve been pretty spoiled with both Electric Jellyfish by Pinthouse Pizza and Tupp&#39;s Double Dry Hop series. However, I&#39;ve noticed a pattern. It&#39;s always Citra, Mosaic, and Galaxy with few exceptions. </p>\n<p>So I decided I wanted to decide a bit different. I also had been reading up on different hop oils due to making the <a href="https://bxyoung89.github.io/brewing-tools/#/hop-directory">hop directory page</a>. I came across a interesting episode of the <a href="https://youtu.be/GCQ22HSDDUQ?t=1310">beersmith podcast</a> talking about the oils. It was suggested to combine hops that are high in Linlaool and Geraniol. In order to find what hops were suitable I made a <a href="/#/hop-visualization">visualization</a>. </p>\n<p>For Linalool I went with El Dorado as I couldn&#39;t find Loral at a good price.</p>\n<p><img src="/brewing-tools/images/blog-images/2019-1-30/hop%20visualization%20linalool.png" alt="linalool" title="Linalool visualization"></p>\n<p>For Geraniol I went with Centennial as there&#39;s a couple of beers I&#39;d like to make with it in the future</p>\n<p><img src="/brewing-tools/images/blog-images/2019-1-30/hop%20visualization%20geraniol.png" alt="geraniol" title="Geraniol visualization"></p>\n<p>Lastly, I wanted to add some Strata in case the combo didn&#39;t work out. </p>\n<p>I also wanted to try out some Voss Kviek. It seemed like it&#39;d be a good match fo the style since it is known for citrus type notes.</p>\n<p>The recipe was as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Grain</th>\n<th align="right">Weight</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Blacklands Pale Moon (American 2-row)</td>\n<td align="right">15lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flaked Wheat</td>\n<td align="right">2lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flaked Oats</td>\n<td align="right">2lbs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rice Hulls**</td>\n<td align="right">1lb</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p> You should add this if you&#39;re trying to reproduce this recipe *</p>\n<p>As you can tell, the recipe is for a double but I only ended up with a single. I got a stuck sparge and my efficiency plummeted. The next batch I did I added rice hulls and had a much better result (0.010 higher in OG!).</p>\n<p>I mashed at 154 for 90 minutes.</p>\n<p>I did a 40 minute boil and here&#39;s the schedule I followed</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Time</th>\n<th>Ingredient</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>0 min</td>\n<td>1oz El Dorado</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 min</td>\n<td>1oz Strata</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25 min</td>\n<td>Whirlflock &amp; Yeast Fuel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Whirlpool</td>\n<td>1oz El Dorado</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>1oz Strata</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>1oz Centennial</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 day dry hop</td>\n<td>1oz El Dorado</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>1oz Strata</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>1oz Centennial</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 day dry hop</td>\n<td>1oz El Dorado</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>1oz Strata</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>1oz Centennial</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>I fermented for 1 week, cold crashed for 3 days, and let it sit in the bottle for 3 weeks. The aroma from the funnel during dry hopping was AMAZING, unfortunately I don&#39;t get much of that same punch now. Kviek was a beast to work with. I was amazed with how fast it fermented. I eventually want to start barrel aging a couple of beers and it will probably be my yeast of choice as it can withstand the Texas heat.</p>\n<p>My OG was 1.062 and my FG was 1.012.  </p>\n'}}]);
