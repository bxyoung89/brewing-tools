# Welcome to Brewing Tools!

Hello! Welcome to my brewing tools site. I wanted to learn more about how everything was calculated. Specifically, I had just switched over to all grain brewing and wanted to see if I was mashing correctly (hint: I wasn't).  But I also learned that I wasn't calculating gravity correctly either. From there I started to get interested in recipe design. I wanted to know bitter my recipes were going to be. I also found a [great pdf](https://www.yakimachief.com/wp-content/uploads/Yakima_Chief_Hops_Varieties.pdf) about different oil contents. I wanted to visualize what oils were in what hops. I made a [beer](./blog/2019-1-30.md) with this information (it turned out okay). Finally I just built the tools that I tend to look up on brew days and bottling days. The big thing for me was that it was mobile friendly. All and all I'm pretty happy with how everything turned out. Probably won't do any major updates unless there's some other calculation to learn but I will stop by with occasional recipes.

Happy Brewing,

Brother Derrick
