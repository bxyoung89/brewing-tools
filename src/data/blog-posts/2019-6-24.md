# Thoughts on kegging

I recently bought a Kegland Series 4 Kegerator. I've been wanting to make the leap to kegging for a while now and I finally did it. It's been quite an experience. A couple things I'd like to note:

### Batteries not included
So while I now owned a refrigerator with towers and taps there were a couple of things that were not included that I wasn't surprised by:
* Kegs. Obviously the kegerator isn't going to come with kegs but what type should you get? I found deals on ball lock so I went with that (see following meme)

	![Keg types meme](/brewing-tools/images/blog-images/2019-6-24/kegs%20meme.png "Deep opinions about kegs")
* Keg disconnects. I went with stailness steel for reasons I guess???
* CO2 tank with CO2

However there were a great deal of things I was surprised I needed to buy
* A regulator that will work for two tanks. I'm still confused why a two tap kegerator wouldn't come with a double body regulator. Must be some black magic I'm missing??
* Proper size hose. The series 4 kegerator comes with some RIDICULOUSLY small lines. I assume this is because they REALLY want to sell their duofit stuff. I needed to buy bigger lines though

### Noob mistakes

Ok so I finally bought all the things and I thought I had everything hooked up correctly. Brewed a beer (recipe to be shown later). 1 week later (bless the power of Kviek and hot texan garages) I put my beer in the keg. Somewhere I read that you should let your beer carb up for a week. Somewhere else I read to carb it up at 40psi. **THESE ARE TWO CONFLICTING PIECES OF ADVICE.** I spent the next two weeks trying to UNCARB this monstrosity. I understand there is variation, but I recently read that you should try 30psi for 2 days. Going to try that soon. (SPOILER ALERT THIS IS ALSO BAD ADVICE. Who knows how long this should be???)

That brings me to my next discovery. I was running low on CO2. I figured this was due to me trying to decarb my ipa so I thought I just needed to fill it up and not do that again.  After doing several weeks of home upgrades I started to develop an affinity for a certain saying my father repeated once or twice 
> Sometimes extra parts are just that... extra.`

When I got my double body regulator in I noticed some curious washers on the side. I didn't think anything of it at the time, so I re-hooked up my completely filled CO2 tank to the regulator and slept. The next day I noticed the tank I had just filled was only a quarter full. I tried teflon taping it and still had leaks, but then I read up on the washers. Put them in and now I have no leaks. I am now looking forward to purchasing my third refill and gaining a reputation around town as the man who hoardes CO2.

### Postives

With those roadblocks on the way, I have to say, it is liberating to just siphon into a keg and call it a day. I don't know what I'm going to do with my previous bottle collection (answer: probably save it exclusively for saisons, kolchs, and ciders) but I can't say I miss it.

Also growlers are a lot more portable than those beautiful belgian bottles.

## Recipes

For my first two recipes that went straight to kegs I decided to go with a classic east-west feud theme.

### Big Hoppa (NEIPA)

I knew I wanted to go with something hazy and I wanted to ferment quickly. I tried to combine a bunch of newer hop varieties that I like.

For the yeast I used Omega Lab's Voss Kviek.

I added 2tsp of Calcium Chloride to the boil (I feel like I would bring this down to 1tsp for future recipes)

| Grain | Weight |
| ------------- |-------------:|
| Blacklands Pale Moon (American 2-row)      | 10lbs |
| Carapils | 1lb |
| Flaked Wheat      | 1lb |
| Flaked Oats | 1lb |
| Rice Hulls | 1lb |

I mashed at 155 for 60 minutes. I ended up doing a 60 minute boil and was aiming for a bitterness of 32 IBUs.

| Time       | Ingredient           |
| ------------- |-------------|
| 0 min | 2tsp CaCl |
|  | 0.5oz HBC 342 (10.9% AA) |
| 30 min | 0.5oz Strata (12.6% AA) |
| 45 min | Whirlflock & Yeast Fuel |
| Whirlpool | 0.5oz HBC 342 |
|  | 0.5oz Strata |
|  | 1oz Idaho 7 (12.5% AA) |
| 1 day dry hop | 1oz HBC |
|  | 1oz Strata |
|  | 1oz Idaho 7 |
| 3 day dry hop | 2oz HBC |
|  | 2oz Strata |
|  | 2oz Idaho 7 |

I got a OG of 1.052 and a FG of 1.007 for a total ABV of 6.01%.

Overall I thought it turned out pretty well. A couple of thoughts
* I should NOT have added the extra teaspoon of Calcium Chloride. First couple of sips have a weird metallic taste (maybe that's the over carbination though)
* I definitely think I'll be adding carapils to my regular NEIPA recipe. I also think I can stand to add probably a pound of some other specialty malt. (Maybe replace the wheat with flaked rye???) 
* This has been my third or fourth beer with Voss Kivek. I'm not sure what it is, but for me this yeast ALWAYS leads to clear beers. I think I'm going to start switching to S04 to get a more hazy appearance.
* I've been reading up more on hop saturation. I don't really need 9oz in there (seems like the max for 5 gal batches is around 7oz)


### Nothing but a Hop Thang (West Coast IPA)

Don't get me wrong. I definitely enjoy the haze craze, but it seems that a lot of breweries are avoiding bitter beers. I know bitterness doesn't really sell as well as it did back in the 90's but I wanted to bring it back. I've also started reading up a bunch more on specialty malts (a.k.a. got suckered in and bought a bunch online) and wanted to experiment with them.

For the yeast I used the standard US05

| Grain | Weight |
| ------------- |-------------:|
| Blacklands Pale Moon (American 2-row)      | 12lbs |
| Munich Malt | 1lb |
| Crystal 15L | 1lb |

Nothing too fancy for the mash. Went for 60 minutes at 150.

I wanted to be bitter but not too bitter. My most involved boil brings me to around 86 IBU.

| Time       | Ingredient           |
| ------------- |-------------|
| 0 min | 0.5oz Citra (13.1% AA) |
| 15 min | 0.5oz Strata (12.6% AA) |
| 30 min | 0.5oz Citra |
| 45 min | Whirlflock & Yeast Fuel |
|  | 0.5oz Idaho 7 (12.5% AA) |
|  | 0.5oz Strata |
| 5 | 0.5oz Citra |
|  | 0.5oz Strata |
|  | 0.5oz Idaho 7 |
| 3 day dry hop | 2oz Medusa (3%AA) |
|  | 0.5oz Citra |
|  | 0.5oz Strata |
|  | 0.7oz Idaho 7 (weird left over XD) |
| 7 day dry hop | 1oz Medusa |
|  | 1oz Strata |
|  | 1oz Idaho 7 |

I got an OG of 1.060 and bone dry FG of 1.003 for an ABVof 7.66%.

![Nothing but a Hop Thang](/brewing-tools/images/blog-images/2019-6-24/hop-thang.jpg "1,2,3, and to the 4 Idaho 7, Medusa, Strata, Citra at yo' do'")

This time I left it at 30psi for two days and it was STILL overcarbed. I'm not sure if it's because my co2 tank is inside the fridge (thus maybe inaccurate readings?) or what. I guess next time I'll try 20 psi for two days...

This beer is pretty fantastic in my estimation. When you first take a sip there's two thoughts that come to mind:
* this does NOT taste like a 7.66% beer
* this does NOT taste like a 86 IBU beer

You get a mouth full of subtle fruity flavors then the bitterness comes: creepin and crawlin'. The munich and crystal malts provide a very faint hint of sweetness. If I were to do this recipe again I might consider bumping one of those up to 2 pounds.
