# Secret Chemistry IPA

One of my favorite styles to emerge in the most recent years has been the New England IPA. I can't seem to get enough of those hoppy juice like beers. Locally I've been pretty spoiled with both Electric Jellyfish by Pinthouse Pizza and Tupp's Double Dry Hop series. However, I've noticed a pattern. It's always Citra, Mosaic, and Galaxy with few exceptions. 

So I decided I wanted to decide a bit different. I also had been reading up on different hop oils due to making the [hop directory page](https://bxyoung89.github.io/brewing-tools/#/hop-directory). I came across a interesting episode of the [beersmith podcast](https://youtu.be/GCQ22HSDDUQ?t=1310) talking about the oils. It was suggested to combine hops that are high in Linlaool and Geraniol. In order to find what hops were suitable I made a [visualization](/#/hop-visualization). 

For Linalool I went with El Dorado as I couldn't find Loral at a good price.

For Geraniol I went with Centennial as there's a couple of beers I'd like to make with it in the future

Lastly, I wanted to add some Strata in case the combo didn't work out. 

I also wanted to try out some Voss Kviek. It seemed like it'd be a good match fo the style since it is known for citrus type notes.

The recipe was as follows:

| Grain | Weight |
| ------------- |-------------:|
| Blacklands Pale Moon (American 2-row)      | 15lbs |
| Flaked Wheat      | 2lbs |
| Flaked Oats | 2lbs |
| Rice Hulls** | 1lb |

As you can tell, the recipe is for a double but I only ended up with a single. I got a stuck sparge and my efficiency plummeted. The next batch I did I added rice hulls and had a much better result (0.010 higher in OG!).

I mashed at 154 for 90 minutes.

I did a 40 minute boil and here's the schedule I followed


| Time       | Ingredient           |
| ------------- |-------------|
| 0 min | 1oz El Dorado |
| 20 min | 1oz Strata |
| 25 min | Whirlflock & Yeast Fuel |
| Whirlpool | 1oz El Dorado |
|  | 1oz Strata |
|  | 1oz Centennial |
| 1 day dry hop | 1oz El Dorado |
|  | 1oz Strata |
|  | 1oz Centennial |
| 3 day dry hop | 1oz El Dorado |
|  | 1oz Strata |
|  | 1oz Centennial |

I fermented for 1 week, cold crashed for 3 days, and let it sit in the bottle for 3 weeks. The aroma from the funnel during dry hopping was AMAZING, unfortunately I don't get much of that same punch now. Kviek was a beast to work with. I was amazed with how fast it fermented. I eventually want to start barrel aging a couple of beers and it will probably be my yeast of choice as it can withstand the Texas heat.

My OG was 1.062 and my FG was 1.012.
